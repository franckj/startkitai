summary: Perform inpainting
operationId: imageInpainting
description: |-
  Inpaintings are for changing something within an image.

  It's very effective at removing something from an image for example.


  The endpoint accepts the image to change, a mask, and a prompt.

  ### Mask
  A mask indicates which areas of the image should be replaced.

  ### Prompt
  The prompt should describe the full new image, not just the erased area.
