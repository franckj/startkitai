  Use this endpoint to send a new message in a chat session and wait for
  a reply from the AI.

  ### Server Sent Events

  We use event-streams a lot for streaming responses back to the client,
  this is what creates the feeling that the AI is typing it's reply back
  to you in real-time, and means we can send very fast partial responses
  to the user. It's essentially web-sockets but simpler.

  The response is returned as `text/event-stream`, **IMPORTANT** make sure
  to provide an `Accept` header with your request so the client can bootstrap
  the connection.

  ```Accept: text/event-stream```

  ### Chat History (optional)

  Chats are organised into sessions, with each session having their history
  stored into the database.

  Chat history is determined by a `chatUuid` variable. If no `chatUuid` is
  provided then a new chat session is created and the `chatUuid` for that
  new session will be returned at the end of the stream.

  ### Context IDs (optional)

  If embeddings have been uploaded via the
  [Embeddings API](https://startkit.ai/api#/paths/api-embeddings-file/post)
  then these can be included in the request using the the `contextIds` variable.

  The AI will fetch the context from the embeddings database automatically
  and use that data in it's response.

  ### Images (optional)

  Images can be provided with the request in base64 format. These images will
  be interpreted by GPT-4-Vision and the description used in the response.

  For example you can send the message "what is in this image?" along with an
  image in the image array, and the AI will analyze the image and respond.

      The response is Streamed back to the client in Server Sent Events (SSE)
      "named event" format (read more on MDN [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format)
      or see the example response.

      Each event consists of two lines, an `event` property and a `data` property.
      Each token of content from the AI will be delivered with a `content` event.


      ```yaml
      # POST http://localhost:1337/api/chat?asJson=true
      # { text: "Hello" }

      event: content
      data: ["Hi"]

      event: content
      data: ["there"],

      event: content
      data: ["how can"]

      event: content
      data: ["I help?"]
      ```

      The stream will end with a `result` event being sent.

      ```yaml
      event: result
      data: {
        "cost": 0.004,
        "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
        "chatUuid": "2c2ddb1e-b6c8-4a74-b2ce-3316147e3043"
      }
      ```

      By default the content in the stream will be base64 encoded, this makes it easy to
      escape special characters and newlines that might otherwise break the stream.

      If you want the response to be delivered as above with the text visible for
      debug purposes then provide the query parameter ?asJson=true to the request.
